## 🧠 About Me

I'm a student with a passion for clean, organized, and powerful development environments.  
I work mostly on Linux (Arch btw), love scripting, and lean toward DevOps/system-level tooling.  
Right now, I'm focused on building a strong portfolio while preparing for university (CS @ Milano Bicocca).

> 🔧 I believe in knowing your tools and building them if they don't exist.
