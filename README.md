## 🛠️ The Philosophy

> "What I cannot build, I do not understand." - Richard Feynman

I believe in **low-level control** and **high-level reliability**.
Whether it's shell scripting to automate workflows or C++ for performance, I focus on the metal, not the bloat.

## 🧰 Technical Arsenal

- **Core:** C++, Python, Bash
- **Environment:** Arch Linux (System Administration & Hardening)
- **Interest Areas:** Industrial Automation, Control Systems, Embedded Logic

## 🚀 Current Focus

- Converting math into code.
- Optimizing workflows (seconds saved = life earned).
- Building the foundation for Industrial Engineering.
